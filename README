DMNotify: A notification script for Irssi based on GMNotify.  When away, sends an Twitter DM on channel highlights/PMs.  Supports responding.
Version: 1.0
Author: Zach Walton

--------------------------------

REQUIRED PACKAGES:

- Net::Twitter

SETUP:

Copy the included dmnotify.yaml to ~/.irssi (make sure it's writable).  You'll 
need to change "destination" to the Twitter username you want to receive
tweets at.

Copy dmnotify.pl to ~/.irssi/scripts/dmnotify.pl.

Within Irssi:

[zorachus] /script load dmnotify.pl

-!- You need to authorize this application.  Retrieve the PIN: 
-!- 
-!- https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=xxxyyyzzzxxxyyyzzz
-!- 
-!- After retrieving the PIN, set it with:
-!- /set dmnotify_auth <PIN>
-!- 
12:48 -!- Irssi: Loaded script dmnotify

Follow the instructions and retrieve the PIN from the URL it generates.  Note
that you'll want to authorize the Twitter account that you want to SEND
DMs from, not receive them at.  I created a separate Twitter account just to
send DMs to my main account and process responses.

That's it!  Please let me know if you run into any bugs.  Also, note that
Twitter limits clients to 350 requests per hour, so I suggest not setting
the polling rate too high.
